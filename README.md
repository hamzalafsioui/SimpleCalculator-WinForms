# Simple Calculator
This is a basic calculator application developed using C# and Windows Forms. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations. The calculator has a user-friendly interface with buttons for numbers, operators, and a result display area.

## Features
* Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%) operations are supported.
* Input validation ensures that only valid numerical and operator inputs are accepted.
* Clear button to reset the input field.
* Return button to delete the last character in the input field.
* Error handling for division by zero and invalid input sequences.
* Calculation logic separates numbers and operators, performs operations based on operator precedence (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction), and displays the result accurately.
## How to Use
* Run the application (.exe file or through Visual Studio).
* Enter numbers and operators using the provided buttons.
* Press the result button to see the calculated result.
* Use the clear button to reset the input field or the return button to delete the last character.
* Enjoy performing simple calculations conveniently!
## Technologies Used
* C# programming language
* Windows Forms for the graphical user interface (GUI)
* .NET Framework for development and execution
## Future Improvements
* Support for more advanced operations such as exponentiation and square root.
* Memory functionality for storing and recalling previous results.
* Improved user interface with themes and customizable layouts.
* Keyboard input support for enhanced usability.
